## INTRODUCTION:
The Customer Shopping Dataset provides a rich, multidimensional view of consumer purchasing behavior,tailored
for uncovering actionable insights to drive business growth. This dataset includes transactional, demographic,
and behavioral data, offering a comprehensive foundation for analyzing trends and patterns in retail shopping.

The primary goal of this analysis is to identify key factors influencing customer behavior, such as demographic
prefrence, and the effectiveness of discount programs. By exploring these dimensions, the analysis seeks to :
1) Determine the most profitable customer segments and shopping channels .
2) Uncover seasonal trends that can guide inventory planning and marketing efforts.

4) Analyze spending patterns across different shopping channels.

   ## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
   Retail businesses face increasing competition and rapidly changing consumer prefrences, making it crucial to
   understand shopping behavior, demographic trends, and product performance. However, without a clear analysis of
   transactional data, businesses may struggle to:
   * identify which product segments drive the most revenue.
   * Determine the effectiveness of promo programs in the product categories.
   * Understand the performance of various purchase channels(bank transfer,credit card,cash,paypal,venmo).
   * Optimize inventory and marketing strategies based on seasonal trends.
   * identify Which purchase channel generated the highest revenue
   * identify Which age group has the highest average transaction value
   * identify which gender group generates the highest revenue

     and reliable results.

  3) Ensure Consistent Format:

     and analyses can be performed accurately without any data type related issues.
